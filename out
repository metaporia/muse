[0m[95mQuote:   [0m[96m"By his sick wifeâ€™s bedside he had for the first time in his life given rein to
         that feeling of tender sympathy which the suffering of others evoked in him and
         which he had till then been ashamed of, as of a weakness; and his pity for her,
         remorse at having wished for her death, and above all the joy of forgiving, in
         itself gave him not only relief from suffering but inward peace such as he had
         never before experienced. Suddenly he felt that the very thing that had been a
         source of suffering to him had become a spiritual joy, and that what had seemed
         insoluble as long as he indulged in censure, recriminations, and hatred, had
         become simple and clear when he forgave and loved."

         become so vivid that they must be brought into conformity with other ideas and
