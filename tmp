From foldoc, The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (05 January 2017):
hello, world hello

   <programming> The canonical, minimal, first program that a programmer
   writes in a new {programming language} or {development environment}.
   The program just prints "hello, world" to {standard output} in order
   to verify that the programmer can successfully edit, compile and run
   a simple program before embarking on anything more challenging.

   Hello, world is the first example program in the {C} programming book,
   {K&R}, and the tradition has spread from there to pretty much every
   other language and many of their textbooks.

   Environments that generate an unreasonably large executable for this
   trivial test or which require a {hairy} compiler-linker invocation
   to generate it are considered bad.

   {Hello, World in over 400 programming languages
   (http://www.roesler-ac.de/wolfram/hello.htm)}.
